<div><center><h2>CS Competitions for Bangladeshi Students</h2></center></div>

Many people think competitive programming is the only path for CS students. However, numerous hackathons and other competitions are organized in Bangladesh. Here is a list of [Competitions for CSE Students](https://github.com/TamimEhsan/Competitions-for-CSE-Students) in Bangladesh, created by my teammate Tamim.

This repository shares all my experiences participating in various CS competitions and the resources I have gathered throughout my journey. If you have any questions, feel free to create an ISSUE here or reach out to me via my social media DMs.
